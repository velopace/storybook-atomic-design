This is unplanned it really just happens. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.</p><img src='http://unsplash.it/1000/400?random&gravity=center' alt=''/><p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. And maybe, maybe, maybe...</p><p>All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Don't fiddle with it all day. This piece of canvas is your world. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Have fun with it.</p><p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Let's do that again.</p><p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p><p>We'll play with clouds today. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Just a little indication.</p><p>If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. It's important to me that you're happy. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>";
